A super simple widget to output related posts based on categories, tags, or custom taxonomies.

== Description ==
Super Simple Related Posts gives you both a widget and a shortcode to output lists of posts related to the current post. You get to decide how the posts are related (categories, tags, custom taxonomies), what to show (posts, pages, custom post types), and a whole lot more. The widget is configurable via **Appearance > Settings** and more info on shortcode usage is provided below.

A [**MIGHTYminnow**](http://mightyminnow.com) plugin.

* **Hide Title**
  Give you the ability to hide the widget title, particularly useful when using the shortcode.

* **Post Types**

`[ssrp title="My Related Posts" post_types="post, page" number_of_posts="3"]`

Here is a list of the available shortcode attributes, which correlate to the settings listed above. Each attribute is listed along with its potential values in quotations, and any default values are listed in parenthesis.

* `post_types="Comma-separated list of post type slugs, in order. E.g. post, page"`
* `taxonomy="Taxonomy slug by which to detemine relatedness. E.g. tag"` (category)
* `orderby="title|name|date|modified|menu_order|author|ID|parent|rand|comment_count"` (date)
